narrativeRole: Place the viewer on the real page and give the reason to act now (limited seats).
keyMessage: C'est sur ongddb.com, et les places sont limitées.

Adapt: keep the zoom-out signature (start tight on a detail, the workspace re-scopes on the landing line); the "workspace" is the island with the phone and props.
Word cues: Rendez-vous@0.24 ongddb.com@1.06 Événements@2.72 Trois panels@3.70 jeunes@4.92 décideurs@5.77 trois cents places@6.75 Pas une de plus@8.09.
Scene 1 (0.0–2.6s): tight on the phone screen (the real event page fills most of the frame) with a white URL pill « ongddb.com › Événements » above it typing in (`discrete-text-sequence` type-on) on « ongddb.com ».
Scene 2 (2.6–3.7s): on « Événements » the camera pulls back (`multi-phase-camera` pull-back, done by ~3.7s): the phone now stands centred on a large cream iso platform, ~45% frame width, upper ~70% of frame.
Scene 3 (3.7–6.6s): on « Trois panels » three small cream chips « Panel 1 · Panel 2 · Panel 3 » stack left of the phone one by one; on « jeunes » / « décideurs » two tiny iso people-tokens (simple cylinders + heads, mint and green) pop onto the platform.
Scene 4 (6.6–8.0s): on « trois cents places » the calendar prop (« 30 OCT. ») rises at left, the map pin « Auditorium AGL » drops at right, the seats cluster rises at lower right with a sun chip « 300 places » (rise from shadow, smooth settle).
Scene 5 (8.0–9.1s): on « Pas une de plus » the « 300 places » chip gets a quick sun highlight sweep (a sun bar wipes behind the text left→right), then hold still.

## Selected blueprint: zoom-out-workspace-reveal

# zoom-out-workspace-reveal — Zoom-Out Workspace Reveal

**intent**: Open TIGHT on one full-bleed detail — a graphic macro or a small UI region — let micro-action play in close-up, then ONE continuous decelerating zoom-out reveals that everything seen so far lives inside a containing whole (a design-tool workspace / a multi-pane agent workspace); the frame locks at the wide and element-level payoff carries on. The zoom-out IS the narrative engine and the reveal-of-nesting is the payoff — distinct from `grid-card-assemble`, where a zoom-OUT is an optional camera modifier garnishing an element-stagger assemble; here nothing assembles, the world was whole all along, and the single outward move is what re-scopes its meaning. The structural inverse of every existing push-in shape (`constellation-hub`'s push-in, `device-surface-showcase`'s continuous push, `dataviz-countup`'s push-through).

**roles served**

- Hook (from `continuous-zoomout-nesting-reveal`): when the open should be a full-bleed graphic mystery — a blob morphing, a macro blossom blooming — resolved by one unbroken exponentially-decelerating zoom-out that passes THROUGH an intermediate composition (oversized headline / card artwork / web page) before revealing the whole thing is an artboard inside a design tool (panels, layers, inspector, timeline); the frame locks and the canvas keeps animating, ending mid-action.
- Benefits (from `close-up-open-single-zoom-out-reveal`): when the payoff is scale/breadth — micro-actions play in extreme close-up on one small UI region (file rows popping in, a highlight stepping, a guided glide down a list), then ONE fast smoothly-decelerating zoom-out (~0.5–1s) reveals the region was a corner of a huge multi-pane agent workspace (chat + artifact preview + sidebar); the wide holds static to the end while element-level payoff completes the story ("look how much the agent did — and here's the deliverable").

**duration**: 6.8–11s (Hook continuous-pull both 6.8s; Benefits dwell-then-snap 10.7–11s — the dwell and the post-lock payoff stretch, the reveal itself does not)

**HARD RULE — no zoom-in anywhere; camera static outside the single reveal.** Carried verbatim from both Benefits goldens and structurally true of both Hook goldens: the camera's only scale motion is OUTWARD. One zoom-out per shot. Before the reveal the camera either holds, glides/pans along the close-up surface, or is already running the (only) pull-back; after the reveal decelerates to a full stop the frame is LOCKED — every later change (pane swap, pane expansion, cursor travel, playhead scrub, canvas animation) is element/layout motion, never camera. No push-in, no punch, no re-zoom, no second reveal. Violating this collapses the shape back into a generic camera tour.

**shot structure** (one oversized static world — the full `[whole: workspace]` authored at final layout from frame 0 — with the camera starting scaled far in on the `[detail]`; the reveal is one scale animation on the world; two folded sub-shapes — **(A) continuous nesting pull** (Hook) and **(B) close-up dwell → snap reveal** (Benefits))

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~2.5s) — full-bleed detail + micro-action.** Extreme close-up: the `[detail: graphic macro — blob / blossom stem / small UI region — file list / browser corner]` fills the frame edge-to-edge with NO containing chrome, canvas, or neighboring panes visible. The detail PERFORMS in close-up — this beat is never a static hold:
  - _Variant — Hook (A)_: the graphic itself moves/morphs/blooms — an organic `[accent]` blob flows across and morphs into an undulating wavy line, or blurred macro forms sharpen as circular petals pop and expand outward into a flat vector `[motif]` — while the pull-back is ALREADY running underneath (the camera never waits).
  - _Variant — Benefits (B)_: camera holds (or glides) while UI micro-action plays — `[rows: filenames / list items]` pop in top-to-bottom, a soft `[highlight]` steps down row-by-row, or the camera rides down a list while gently pulling back. Optional blur-to-sharp resolve on the opening frame.

- **Scene 2 (~2.5s–reveal start) — the middle beat.** Diverges by sub-shape:
  - _Variant — Hook (A) — intermediate nesting level_: the continuing zoom-out resolves a mid-level composition, still full-bleed, still no chrome — oversized `[headline]` glyphs descend into frame as partial letterforms and settle centered (the "descent" is pure world-scale: the letters are static in world space, the camera pull produces the motion), or the `[motif]` is revealed living inside a `[card]` in a row of cards on a `[web page]`. The viewer re-scopes once — and still doesn't know the real container.
  - _Variant — Benefits (B) — close-up beat advances_: the close-up story develops at the same tightness — the view shifts to an adjacent `[panel]`, a new `[row]` fades/slides in and grows its panel, a `[cursor]` enters and hovers it with a soft highlight. This is the pre-reveal dwell; tension is "we're deep inside something."

- **Scene 3 (the reveal) — ONE decelerating zoom-out completes; frame LOCKS.** The signature move. The camera pulls back to scale 1 and eases to a full stop, revealing the containing `[whole]`:
  - _Variant — Hook (A)_: the pull is the tail of the SAME continuous zoom running since frame 0 (total travel ~4.3–4.5s of a 6.8s shot), with strong exponential deceleration — the `[intermediate composition]` turns out to be `[an artboard / a phone-screen mock]` on a `[design-tool canvas]`: light chrome, left pages/layers panel, right properties inspector, blue selection box, bottom animation timeline with keyframe bars.
  - _Variant — Benefits (B)_: the pull is a discrete rapid burst (~0.5–1s) from the held close-up — smooth, heavily decelerating — landing the full `[multi-pane agent workspace]`: left `[chat pane]` with the prompt + status + response, center/right `[artifact pane: spreadsheet / deck preview]`, optional `[sidebar: progress checklist + artifacts + context]`.
  - Both: the zoom-out ends BEFORE the shot does — always leave a post-lock act. The deceleration-to-stop is what makes the lock legible.

- **Scene 4 (lock–end) — element-level payoff on the locked wide.** The reveal is not the ending; the close-up's world keeps living inside the wide. All motion is element/layout:
  - _Variant — Hook (A)_: a `[cursor]` enters from off-frame and glides to hover/click the selected element, or a `[playhead]` scrubs left-to-right across the bottom timeline while the canvas artwork animates in sync (petals rotate about their hub, a starburst spins in place, a motif sweeps/shifts). Ends MID-ACTION — the tool is alive.
  - _Variant — Benefits (B)_: a `[file-attachment card]` fades in → the cursor clicks `[Open]` → the artifact pane swaps content via a quick white-out → the viewer pane expands full-width over its neighbor (LAYOUT motion, not camera) landing on the `[deliverable: full slide / dashboard]`; or the frame simply holds long and static while the cursor drifts to rest near the `[payoff stat]`. Struck-through checklist items in the sidebar read as completed work. Long hold to the end.

**motion vocabulary**: one continuous scale-driven zoom-out with exponential/eased deceleration (no cuts) · single fast decelerating zoom-out burst (~0.5–1s) · workspace-lock at zoom end · full-bleed no-chrome opening · blur-to-sharp macro focus resolve · organic blob flow + morph into undulating wavy line · squiggle-underline settle with residual undulation · circular petals popping/expanding outward (bloom) · oversized letters descending into frame as partial glyphs (world-scale, not element motion) · text scaling down through the frame to a centered settle · rows pop in top-to-bottom · selection highlight steps down row-by-row · camera rides/pans down a list while pulling back · new row fades/slides in and grows its panel · cursor hover with soft row highlight · cursor entering from off-frame and gliding to hover/click · timeline playhead scrub left-to-right · in-canvas rotation about a hub / spin-in-place · motif shift/sweep-in · file-attachment card fade-in · cursor click · pane content swap via quick white-out · pane expands full-width over neighbor (layout motion) · checklist items shown struck-through · long static hold · cursor drift to rest · ends mid-action (Hook).

**rule mapping** (motion verb → `rule-id`)

- the single decelerating zoom-out on the whole world → `viewport-change` (one `.world` wrapper; `cam` object as single source of truth via `onUpdate`; start `cam.scale` at the reveal ratio with `T = -offset × S` centering the detail, tween scale → 1 and translate → 0 with ONE shared ease — the detail drifts from frame-center to its home slot as the wide takes over, exactly the golden read)
- off-center detail framed at open, zoom-out to wide → `coordinate-target-zoom` ("Zoom out (target → wide view)" variation — nested wrappers, reverse phases: start zoomed on the measured target, tween outer scale → 1 + inner translate → 0 with shared duration/ease; measure the detail's center after `fonts.ready`, never hand-derive)
- pre-reveal glide/ride down a list while gently pulling back (Benefits B) → `viewport-change` (pan + scale composed on the one `cam` object) — sequencing the slow-glide → hold → fast-pull profile → `multi-phase-camera` (phase machinery; this shape runs the same scale-agnostic math at 4–12× outward — see `viewport-change`'s scale-guide range note)
- exponential deceleration-to-stop → ease selection (`expo.out` / `power4.out` on the reveal tween) — parameter guidance, no rule needed; after the stop, NO camera tweens exist on the timeline (hard rule above)
- blur-to-sharp macro resolve chorded to the early pull → `depth-of-field-blur` (refocus/settle variation: `--dof` ramps to 0 as the zoom recedes, same timeline position as the pull)
- oversized partial glyphs descending / text scaling down through the frame → no element tween — authored static in world space; `viewport-change`'s pull produces the motion (author trap: animating the letters separately double-moves them)
- organic blob flow + morph into wavy line → SVG path morph — see `hyperframes-keyframes` (morph); flagged special, like `device-surface-showcase`'s WebGL specials — substitute a non-morph accent when the capability isn't loaded
- squiggle-underline residual undulation → `sine-wave-loop` (finite bounded undulation)
- circular petals pop/expand outward (bloom) → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered pops) + `center-outward-expansion` (petals expand from the hub to final positions)
- rows pop in top-to-bottom → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group, ≤500ms stagger cap) or `gsap-effects` (low-drama fade + short slide stagger)
- selection highlight steps down row-by-row → `gsap-effects` (stepped `tl.set` repositions at time thresholds — instant steps, no glide; trivial, no dedicated rule needed)
- new row fades/slides in → `spring-pop-entrance` (soft variant); its panel growing to fit → `anchored-layout-expand` (one-axis layout expansion)
- cursor enters off-frame → glides → hovers → clicks → `cursor-click-ripple` (move-to-target, co-depress, ripple); soft hover row-highlight → `gsap-effects` (background-color/opacity tween)
- timeline playhead scrub left-to-right → `gsap-effects` (linear `ease:"none"` translateX); in-sync canvas animation = place the artwork tweens at the same timeline position as the scrub (sync is free on one paused timeline)
- in-canvas rotation about a hub / spin-in-place (petal flower, starburst) → `svg-icon-enrichment` (SVG `setAttribute('transform','rotate(deg cx cy)')` for explicit centers)
- motif shift/sweep-in on a card → `gsap-effects` (masked translate) or `techniques.md` clip-path reveal
- file-attachment card fade-in → `spring-pop-entrance` (soft) / `gsap-effects` fade
- pane content swap via quick white-out → `discrete-text-sequence` (whole-state swap at a threshold) + `gsap-effects` (white flash overlay with attack-decay opacity envelope)
- pane expands full-width over neighbor (layout motion) → `anchored-layout-expand` (one-axis layout hand-off; width/height tweens stay forbidden)
- checklist items struck-through / status states → static content, or `discrete-text-sequence` if they check off on screen
- long static hold + cursor drift to rest → hold needs no rule; the drift is a single slow `gsap-effects` translate that ARRIVES somewhere meaningful (rests near the payoff stat) — it performs, it is not idle wobble
- ends mid-action (Hook) → the playhead/canvas tweens simply run to the composition edge — no exit move, no rule

**camera law — staging the one move** (the camera is the engine here, not a modifier)

- Build the ENTIRE `[whole]` workspace at final layout inside one `.world` wrapper; there is no second set. The open is `cam.scale = S0` (typically 4–12× — whatever makes the `[detail]` full-bleed) with counter-translate centering the detail; the reveal tweens to `scale 1, translate 0`. `overflow: hidden` on the scene; background on the scene, never the world.
- Crispness constraint: everything visible at open must survive S0 magnification — author the detail as DOM/vector (text, SVG, CSS shapes); any raster inside the close-up needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × S0`.
- Sub-shape A: the reveal tween spans ~0–4.5s with `expo.out`-class deceleration — one tween, no phases, no cuts; element beats (morph, bloom, glyph settle) are positioned along it.
- Sub-shape B: optional gentle pre-reveal pan/pull (`viewport-change` pan, or a slow scale ease-out ≤ ~15% travel) during the dwell, then the reveal burst (~0.5–1s, heavy decel) as its own tween; camera fully static after.
- Never: a zoom-in, a second zoom-out, camera motion after the lock, or replacing the reveal with a cut. One outward move is the whole grammar.

**boundary vs `grid-card-assemble`**: it already carries an optional zoom-OUT reveal modifier (glass-card / logo-wall variants), so the two shapes border each other. The test: if elements ASSEMBLE and the pull-back merely shows the assembled array in context, it's `grid-card-assemble`; if the world is whole from frame 0 and the single decelerating pull-back is itself the story — close-up mystery → nesting reveal → locked-frame payoff — it's this blueprint. Related evidence: a mined profile-page golden runs the same single UI zoom-out/scroll-up reveal at small scale inside a kinetic-type shot, corroborating the move's currency without sharing the shape.

# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* monospace required — proportional jitters even in a fixed box */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  font-size: TERMINAL_FONT_SIZE;
}
.text-wrap {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  min-width: TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH; /* ≥ widest state — stops right-edge jitter */
  white-space: nowrap;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width */
  width: CURSOR_WIDTH;
}
```

```js
// Each entry shows from its t until the NEXT entry's t.
// Shape: keystrokes → typo → backspace to the fork → bulk paste → completion mark.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "" },
  { t: T_K1, text: "{p1}" }, // first keystrokes (~3-5 chars, 0.1-0.2s apart)
  { t: T_K2, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_typo}" }, // continuation containing a typo
  { t: T_BS, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_partial}" }, // backspace(s) — peel back to the fork
  { t: T_BULK, text: "{fullCorrectedText}" }, // bulk paste — many chars in one jump
  { t: T_DONE, text: "{fullCorrectedText + ' ✓'}" }, // completion marker
];

// Reverse-search for the latest entry whose t has passed
function textAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i].text;
  }
  return "";
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = textAt(driver.t);
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.

# Multi-Phase Camera

A camera wrapper around the ENTIRE scene that progresses through discrete zoom phases at scripted triggers, with continuous sine-driven micro-drift overlaid so the camera never feels static between phases. Distinct from a single linear zoom — multi-phase creates cinematic pacing (anticipation → reveal → settle).

## How It Works

The camera is one wrapping `<div>` whose `transform: scale() translate(x, y)` is composed from two channels inside a single `onUpdate` writer:

1. **Phase scale** — a proxy object `{ scale }` stepped through phases at trigger times (`PHASE_1_SCALE` at t=0 → `PHASE_2_SCALE` at `PHASE_2_AT` → `PHASE_3_SCALE` at `PHASE_3_AT`).
2. **Drift offset** — a continuous sine-based `translateX` / `translateY` (small amplitude, slow frequency) ADDED to the phase transform. X and Y run at slightly different frequencies (`DRIFT_FREQ_RATIO ≈ 1.3`) — equal frequencies produce a perfect diagonal that reads mechanical; ~1.3 gives an organic Lissajous.

## Recipe

```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — any phase scale < 1 exposes the content's edges */
  background: {sceneBgColor}; /* background on .scene, NOT .camera — a camera-borne

}
.camera {

  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* off-center origin creates phase-to-phase drift */

}
```

```js
const camera = document.getElementById("camera");

// Three-phase scale plan: pullback → focus → push.
const phase = { scale: PHASE_1_SCALE }; // Phase 1 is the initial value — no tween

// Phase 2 — settle to neutral focus
tl.to(phase, { scale: PHASE_2_SCALE, duration: PHASE_2_DUR, ease: PHASE_2_EASE }, PHASE_2_AT);

// Phase 3 — slow push-in for the climax
tl.to(phase, { scale: PHASE_3_SCALE, duration: PHASE_3_DUR, ease: PHASE_3_EASE }, PHASE_3_AT);

// Drift driver — continuous sine motion overlaid on the phase scale.
// The ONE writer of camera.style.transform.
const drift = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  drift,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * DRIFT_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION, // spans the whole composition
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const dx = Math.sin(drift.p) * DRIFT_AMP_X;
      const dy = Math.sin(drift.p * DRIFT_FREQ_RATIO) * DRIFT_AMP_Y;
      camera.style.transform = `scale(${phase.scale}) translate(${dx}px, ${dy}px)`;
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Content reveals happen INSIDE the camera frame (hero/tagline/cta beats).

| **Focus-in**        | back → neutral → slight push      | Approach → settle → slight push | Default product reveal        |
| **Dramatic reveal** | push → neutral → pull             | Wide → focus → settle back      | Hero shot with breathing room |
| **Steady push**     | neutral → slight push → more push | Gradual forward momentum        | Continuous narrative push     |
| **Bookend pull**    | neutral → strong push → neutral   | Settle → push → release         | CTA emphasis then release     |

## Variations

- **Phase trigger by content beat**: align a camera tween's start with a content tween's end (entry completes → push begins) rather than a fixed clock value.
- **Camera shake (panic / impact)**: a brief higher-amplitude, higher-frequency drift tween over a short window — same `drift` mechanism with `SHAKE_AMP` / `SHAKE_CYCLES` / `SHAKE_DUR` at `SHAKE_AT`.
- **Targeted zoom into an off-center element**: combine scale with counter-translation so the target lands at viewport center — divide the measured offset by the current scale before feeding it into the writer:

```js
const tRect = document.querySelector(".cta").getBoundingClientRect();
const offsetX = (STAGE_W / 2 - (tRect.left + tRect.width / 2)) / phase.scale;
const offsetY = (STAGE_H / 2 - (tRect.top + tRect.height / 2)) / phase.scale;
// then in onUpdate: translate(offsetX + dx, offsetY + dy)
```

## Values

| token                       | range                                    | notes                                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PHASE_1 / 2 / 3_SCALE       | 0.88–0.96 / 0.98–1.02 / 1.04–1.15        | tighter spread = subtler camera; scale < 1 REQUIRES `overflow: hidden` on `.scene`  |
| PHASE_2_AT / PHASE_2_DUR    | 0.3–1.0s / 1.0–1.8s                      | longer DUR = slower settle, more cinematic                                          |
| PHASE_3_AT / PHASE_3_DUR    | 2.0–4.0s / 1.0–2.0s                      | PHASE_3_AT ≥ PHASE_2_AT + PHASE_2_DUR or focus is preempted                         |
| PHASE_2_EASE / PHASE_3_EASE | `power2.out` `power3.out` `power2.inOut` | spring/back easing on a camera feels uncomfortable; each later phase settles deeper |
| TOTAL_DURATION              | = `data-duration`                        | the drift tween must span the whole composition                                     |
| DRIFT_CYCLES                | 1–3                                      | 1 = one slow breath; high values read as mechanical wobble                          |
| DRIFT_AMP_X / DRIFT_AMP_Y   | 2–8 px / 1–4 px                          | imperceptible per-frame, visible over time — if it reads as a shake, it's too much  |
| DRIFT_FREQ_RATIO            | 1.2–1.5                                  | 1.0 = perfect diagonal (mechanical); ~1.3 = organic Lissajous                       |
| HERO_AT (etc.)              | after Phase-2 settle lands               | a hero fading in mid-pull-back feels like it's flying away                          |

## Critical Constraints

- **Camera wraps EVERYTHING in the scene** — a per-element camera creates parallax bugs and breaks the "one viewpoint" read.
- **One writer**: phase scale and drift compose inside the single drift `onUpdate`; nothing else touches `camera.style.transform`.
- **`overflow: hidden` on `.scene`** — required whenever any phase scale < 1.
- **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on `.camera`** — off-center origin creates unpredictable phase-to-phase drift.
- **Scene background on `.scene`, not `.camera`** — otherwise scaling/translating reveals the outer void.
- **Hero reveal starts AFTER the initial pull-back ease lands** — otherwise the headline feels like it's flying away.
